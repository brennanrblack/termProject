  <p id="p1"> Hi, my name is Brennan Black. Growing up, I took up a number of
  hobbies that I continue to enjoy. One of my hobbies is sailing, I started
  sailing when I was 8 years old and I have continued to sail with friends and
  family ever since. My favorite sail boat is the laser, which is a one man
  racing boat.

     <h3>Hiking</h3>
  <p id="p2"> Another one of my hobbies is hiking. I grew up hiking with the
  Boy Scouts and we would typically hike on the Appalachian Trail. When I was
  in high school, I went out to California with some friends and we hiked 40
  miles in the Sierra Nevada mountains. The scenery was beautiful and it was
  one of my favorite trips ever.
