  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p id="p1"> Hi everyone! My name is Brennan Black and I am a senior at
  Washington and Lee University. I am from Fairfield, Connecticut and I grew up
  sailing, playing football, and rowing crew. Some hobbies that I enjoy are
  hiking, cooking, playing rugby, learning about history, and reading science
  fiction novels.

  <p id="p2"> In five years, I hope to have made progress towards building a
  career that fulfills me. I am currently interested in working in either a
  sales or marketing role for a software company. I am interested in working in
  tech because of the impact these company's products have on society and
  because of the workplace culture at these firms.
  I want to work for a company that is doing something new and exciting while
  also providing a benefit to society. The notion of social benefit is
  espcecially important to me because I don't just want to have a job to make
  money; I to love what I or at the very least feel that what I do is important
  and helps others. I find the video above to be helpful when I am in doubt about
  my tentative career path. I have ideas of what I want to do but I find it
  difficult to commit because I am afraid that I will pick the wrong thing. This
  is a predicament unique to our generation because there are so many different
  career paths that we can take and choices that we have to make that it can
  make doing anything difficult. However, I know that there is not one perfect
  job for me, there are plenty of careers that can be fulfilling and beneficial
  to myself and to the world. In short, there is no perfect job so just find
  one that works for you. If you would like to learn more about interests,

  <p id="p3"> I hope that by the age of 26 I have developed strong self
  discipline. At this current point in my life, I feel that I am held back from
  achieving my goals because I am not disciplined. I want to have a more normal
  sleep schedule so that I can fell well rested and ready for the day. I want to
  make fitness a priority every day so that I can be healthy and have the physical
  and mental strength to take on the challenges that are ahead of me. I want to
  eat clean so that I can be energized throughout the day and take care of my
  body so that I can live a long and healthy life. These things are easy in concept
  but very difficult in practice. It takes a lot of hard work to break bad habits
  and to develop the internalized discipline to go against your base desires. This
  is something that I have struggled with for a while but I am determined to make
  it happen because I know that it will improve the quality of my life and will
  make me a more productive and positive person. The picture above is a book that
  I am reading about how to change your negative habits and develop the discipline
  needed to keep the difficult yet beneficial ones.
